This code sucks...

MAKE THIS DIRECTORY

IMSRG_HOME/src/
IMSRG_HOME/TBMEfiles/
IMSRG_HOME/output/
IMSRG_HOME/hamiltonians

place the ME.bin in TBMEfiles

install arpack on your system

it's like

sudo apt-get libarpak-dev

or something...

Also need lapack and blas and gfortran

makefile should be gfortran, but if not, copy "makefile_gfortran" onto makefile

hopefully this works.



: make

makes the ode solver version

: make magnus

makes the magnus version


Mangus version has not been cared for in a long time, don't hold me accountable for it right now.



usage:

./gs_decouple N hw R ML MS



N = electrons  (2,6,12,20...)
hw = float (0.5,1.0...)
R = shells (3,4,5,6...)

ML = (0,\pm 1,\pm 2,3... )
MS = (0,\pm 1)
